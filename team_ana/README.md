# Empirical Analysis of Team Size

Figure [dblp_nature](dblp_nature.pdf) and Figure [pmc_nature](pmc_nature.pdf) illustrates the relationship between team size and the predicted disruption index in different research contexts. In the PubMed dataset, as depicted in Figure [pmc_nature](pmc_nature.pdf), a clear downward trend indicates that larger teams tend to produce less disruptive research. This supports the findings presented in nature paper, suggesting a generalizable trend across many scientific fields.

Conversely, the DBLP dataset, which focuses on computer science, shown in Figure [dblp_nature](dblp_nature.pdf), does not conform to this trend. Instead, it exhibits a pattern where an increase in team size correlates with more disruptive research. This deviation might be due to the specific nature of the fields within the DBLP dataset not covered in the analysis of nature paper. Generally, larger teams outperform smaller ones, possibly due to the collaborative nature of emerging fields in computing. Larger teams bring a diversity of expertise and innovative approaches, and they also have advantages in terms of resources and manpower, which can lead to greater disruptive impacts. This suggests that the relationship between team size and disruption could vary significantly across different fields of study.
